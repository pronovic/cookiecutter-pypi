# Cookiecutter Template - PyPI Project

This is a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) template to create
a [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)-based Python project to be distributed at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).
The project structure follows the pattern from the [apologies](https://github.com/pronovic/apologies)
demonstration project, using my [run-script-framework](https://github.com/pronovic/run-script-framework) and
shared GitHub Actions workflows from [gha-shared-workflows](https://github.com/pronovic/gha-shared-workflows).
